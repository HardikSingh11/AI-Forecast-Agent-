Project Documentation – Smart Demand & Trend Forecasting Agent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Overview
A small Streamlit tool that standardises the “first pass” on a time-series:
- cleans and resamples the series
- fits a Prophet forecast
- reports simple error metrics
- shows a seasonal decomposition (when possible)
- produces a short commentary in plain language
Everything runs locally.

2) Problem & Scope
Problem: repeated “quick forecasts” are slow and inconsistent when done by hand.
Scope:
- single metric at a time
- daily/weekly/monthly data
- local, lightweight text generation (no paid APIs)
Out of scope:
- multivariate/exogenous regressors
- production scheduling and alerting
- full backtesting suite (future work)

3) How it works (summary)
- Read CSV/XLSX → detect date & numeric columns (user can override)
- Resample to a tidy index; fill small gaps
- Fit Prophet; forecast horizon in days/weeks/months
- Metrics (MAPE/MAE/RMSE) on historical range
- Optional decomposition (trend/seasonal/residual)
- Commentary from a small local model
- Export forecast to CSV

4) Components
- forecasting_utils.py: prepare_data(), build_forecast(), in_sample_metrics(), seasonal_decompose_figure()
- forecast_agent_app.py: Streamlit UI and workflow
- generate_time_data.py: quick synthetic data generator

5) Data requirements
- One date/datetime column
- One numeric metric to forecast
- Reasonable frequency (daily/weekly/monthly). App can infer or accept manual input.

6) Privacy & security
- Local-first: no data leaves the machine
- Insight model only rephrases computed statistics
- Keep sample datasets light and non-sensitive

7) Roadmap ideas
- ARIMA/Auto-ARIMA toggle
- Holiday effects (Prophet country calendars)
- Exogenous regressors (price, promo, weather)
- Proper backtesting (hold-out / rolling)
- Database connectors and scheduled runs

FAQ
-----
Q: Can it forecast more than one metric at once?
A: One at a time. The UI is simpler and results are easier to interpret.

Q: Do I need the internet?
A: Only for initial package/model download. After that, it runs locally.

Q: How accurate is it?
A: It’s a quick first pass. Use metrics as a guide; add backtesting for robust evaluation.

Q: Why not GPT-4 for commentary?
A: To keep cost and setup near zero. The code is modular — swapping to a paid API is straightforward if needed.

Q: What if model downloads are slow?
A: Use `distilgpt2` for very fast, small downloads; it’s good enough for short text.
